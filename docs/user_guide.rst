========
Login
========

When you open FLAT, you will be presented a login screen. This is where you
enter your username and password, as well as select what *configuration* you
want to use. FLAT supports multiple *configurations*, which allows
for using the same FLAT installation for multiple annotation projects, choose
the configuration that corresponds to your project.

The login form may or may not offer an option to register a user account, if
you do not have one yet.


===================
Document Index
===================

After logging in, you will see an index of all your documents, organised into
folders and possibly subfolders. By default, there will be one folder
corresponding to your username. This is your personal workspace.

You may also see directories of others if the administrators have given you
explicit rights to do so.

Upload document
---------------------

You can upload FoLiA documents by clicking the **Upload document** button
and selecting a local file to upload. Note that only `FoLiA
<https://proycon.github.io/folia/>`_ documents are
supported, a very specific file format for linguistic annotation.

Administrators may have disabled this functionality.
